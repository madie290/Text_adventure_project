<p>As you open the door on the left you hope that with the sounds of people you might be able to blend in as a member of the staff. Though when you finally open the door you find yourself in a guards room. One of the guards questions why you are here, and knowing that you have been caught you turn to run. You make it all of five steps before a knife finds its way into your back.
